# House Pricing Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

This is a simple linear regression model that predicts house prices using area information. Given the size of a house (in square feet), the model estimates the corresponding price (in Us $dollars).


## Introduction

This project aims to provide a basic understanding of how linear regression can be used to predict house prices based on the area of the houses. The model utilizes the concept of linear regression to establish a relationship between the independent variable (area) and the dependent variable (price).

## Installation

Following dependencies have been used to create the model

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Output Prediction
The model will output the predicted price for the given house size.
